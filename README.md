Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with
- Tailwind Css
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
- Overlay color on an image
  ```html
  <div style="background: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);"  class="rounded-t-lg">
    <img class="opacity-40" src="/images/image-header-mobile.jpg" alt="stats preview">
  </div>
  ```
- Text formating
- Make text flow onto mutltiple lines by setting a width limit on the text element or its container
- Whitespace
- combine width limit of text with whitespacing to create a multiline text with normal or uniform word spacing

### Continued development

#### whitespace

### Useful resources

- [Image color overlay resource](https://dev.to/ellen_dev/two-ways-to-achieve-an-image-colour-overlay-with-css-eio) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to overlay an image with a color. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
